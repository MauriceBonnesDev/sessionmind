# Sessionmind

Sessionmind is a lightweight CLI and Neovim-integrated productivity tool that helps you stay focused by tracking your tasks, measuring session time, and keeping context across your development sessions.
It lets you manage todos, automatically logs time spent per task and session, and is designed to become your personal developer memory – reminding you where you left off, what you’ve accomplished, and what’s next.
